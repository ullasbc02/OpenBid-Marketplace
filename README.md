# Group 07 - OpenBid-Marketplace Project

## Project Overview  
This project aims to design and develop a comprehensive **online auction site** that enables seamless digital auctions for products provided by sellers. The core focus is on three critical components:

- **Registering Products to Sell:** A module allowing sellers to list their products with detailed descriptions, images, starting bids, and auction timing.  
- **Bidding on Items:** Real-time bidding functionality enabling buyers to place and update bids dynamically while the auction is live.  
- **Customer Reviews of Sellers:** A review system to promote credibility and trust, letting customers rate and provide feedback on sellers post-auction.

## Scenario  
Our organization requires a secure, scalable, and user-friendly auction platform that supports multiple user roles:  

- **Sellers:** Register and manage auction listings.  
- **Buyers:** Participate in live auctions by placing bids on items.  
- **Customers:** Provide reviews and ratings of sellers to help other users make informed decisions.  
- **Administrators:** Oversee product listings, bidding activities, and seller reviews to maintain site quality and compliance.
