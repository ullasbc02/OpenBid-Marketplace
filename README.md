# Group 07 - OpenBid-Marketplace Project

## Project Overview  
This project aims to design and develop a comprehensive **online auction site** that enables seamless digital auctions for products provided by sellers. The core focus is on three critical components:

- **Registering Products to Sell:** A module allowing sellers to list their products with detailed descriptions, images, starting bids, and auction timing.  
- **Bidding on Items:** Real-time bidding functionality enabling buyers to place and update bids dynamically while the auction is live.  
- **Customer Reviews of Sellers:** A review system to promote credibility and trust, letting customers rate and provide feedback on sellers post-auction.

## Scenario  
Our organization requires a secure, scalable, and user-friendly auction platform that supports multiple user roles:  

- **Sellers:** Register and manage auction listings.  
- **Buyers:** Participate in live auctions by placing bids on items.  
- **Customers:** Provide reviews and ratings of sellers to help other users make informed decisions.  
- **Administrators:** Oversee product listings, bidding activities, and seller reviews to maintain site quality and compliance.

## Team Members  
- Ullas Basavapatna Chandrashekar  
- Saptorshee Nag

## Project Goals  
- Develop an in-house solution that integrates product registration, bidding, and review functionalities.  
- Ensure real-time updates during bidding to enhance user engagement.  
- Provide an intuitive interface that caters to diverse user roles with appropriate permissions.  
- Implement administrative tools for monitoring and moderation to maintain auction integrity.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

üëâ This gives you a **clear MVP roadmap**: Start with *auth + listings + real-time bidding + reviews + admin panel*. Add payments, filters, and notifications later.

Would you like me to **draft a feature breakdown (MVP vs Future Enhancements)** in a table format so you can use it as your project plan?


Great clarification ‚úÖ ‚Äî since this is a **student project**, you want something:

* **Free** (no paid services, SaaS bills, or licenses).
* **Technically strong** (shows you can handle scalability, real-time, secure auth).
* **Practical** (not over-engineered, but realistic enough for employers to value).

Let‚Äôs break down **why we picked Next.js + Prisma + PostgreSQL + Socket.IO** for your auction project ‚Äî compared to other stacks:

---

## üîπ 1. Free & Open-Source

* **Next.js** ‚Üí Open-source, deploy free on **Vercel** (1-click).
* **Prisma** ‚Üí Free ORM, works with any DB.
* **PostgreSQL** ‚Üí Free & open-source, can host locally or on **Render / Railway / Supabase free tier**.
* **Socket.IO** ‚Üí Free for real-time WebSockets.
* **NextAuth.js** ‚Üí Free for authentication.

üëâ Unlike Firebase or AWS, you won‚Äôt risk hitting a billing wall.

## üîπ 2. Technical Fit for Auction Platform

An auction site isn‚Äôt just a CRUD app. It needs **real-time updates, reliability, and role-based features**. Let‚Äôs see how this stack fits technically:

| **Requirement**                                      | **Why this stack fits**                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Real-Time Bidding**                                | Socket.IO (WebSockets) provides instant bid updates ‚Üí no need to refresh pages.                                                          |
| **Relational Data (users, listings, bids, reviews)** | PostgreSQL is relational, ensures constraints (e.g., a bid must belong to a valid auction). Better than MongoDB for financial-like data. |
| **Seller Reviews & Ratings**                         | Easy to model in SQL (foreign keys: buyer ‚Üí seller).                                                                                     |
| **Admin Monitoring**                                 | Prisma makes it easy to query complex relationships (e.g., all bids on all auctions by a seller).                                        |
| **Scalability**                                      | Next.js allows server-side rendering for public auction pages (SEO-friendly, scalable).                                                  |
| **Authentication**                                   | NextAuth integrates with Next.js ‚Üí secure login without building auth from scratch.                                                      |

---

## üîπ 3. Why Not Other Stacks?

* **PERN (your bootcamp stack)**

  * You‚Äôd need to set up REST API + React + Express separately.
  * Real-time = extra work.
  * Next.js unifies frontend + backend ‚Üí less tedious.

* **Firebase**

  * Free up to a limit, but Firestore is NoSQL (not great for relational auction data).
  * Less control ‚Üí doesn‚Äôt showcase your backend design skills.

* **Supabase**

  * Very tempting (auth + DB + realtime built-in).
  * But then most backend logic is handled for you ‚Üí not great for interviews where they expect you to explain design.

* **GraphQL (Apollo/MERN)**

  * GraphQL is cool, but adds complexity (schema, resolvers, subscriptions).
  * Overkill for a student auction project. REST/WebSockets are simpler.

---

## üîπ 4. Employer Perspective

Recruiters and interviewers look for:

* **Modern frameworks** (Next.js, Prisma ‚Üí check ‚úÖ).
* **Solid backend design** (Postgres + Socket.IO ‚Üí check ‚úÖ).
* **Understanding of system design** (real-time + roles + auth ‚Üí check ‚úÖ).
* **Free deployment** (so they can actually see your project live ‚Üí check ‚úÖ).

This stack demonstrates:

* You know SQL (important for interviews).
* You can build **real-time systems** (not just CRUD apps).
* You‚Äôre familiar with **fullstack frameworks used in industry**.

---

## üîπ 5. Free Deployment Options

* **Frontend + Backend (Next.js app)** ‚Üí Vercel (100% free).
* **Database (Postgres)** ‚Üí

  * Free hosting on **Supabase**, **Railway**, **Render**, or **Neon**.
* **Realtime (Socket.IO)** ‚Üí Runs inside Next.js API routes (no extra cost).
* **Auth (NextAuth.js)** ‚Üí Free & open source.

So you can build & deploy **100% free**.

---

‚úÖ **In summary:**
We chose **Next.js + Prisma + PostgreSQL + Socket.IO** because it is:

* **Free & open source** (ideal for students).
* **Technically aligned** with real-time auctions, relational data, auth, and roles.
* **Modern & job-ready** (relevant buzzwords for employers).
* **Less tedious than PERN** (Next.js unifies frontend/backend, Prisma handles DB cleanly).

---

Would you like me to now **map the high-level architecture** (frontend, backend, DB, real-time, auth, admin) with this stack in a simple diagram + workflow? That way you‚Äôll *see how requests and real-time events flow*.
