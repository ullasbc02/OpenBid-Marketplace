# Group 07 - OpenBid-Marketplace Project

## Project Overview  
This project aims to design and develop a comprehensive **online auction site** that enables seamless digital auctions for products provided by sellers. The core focus is on three critical components:

- **Registering Products to Sell:** A module allowing sellers to list their products with detailed descriptions, images, starting bids, and auction timing.  
- **Bidding on Items:** Real-time bidding functionality enabling buyers to place and update bids dynamically while the auction is live.  
- **Customer Reviews of Sellers:** A review system to promote credibility and trust, letting customers rate and provide feedback on sellers post-auction.

## Scenario  
Our organization requires a secure, scalable, and user-friendly auction platform that supports multiple user roles:  

- **Sellers:** Register and manage auction listings.  
- **Buyers:** Participate in live auctions by placing bids on items.  
- **Customers:** Provide reviews and ratings of sellers to help other users make informed decisions.  
- **Administrators:** Oversee product listings, bidding activities, and seller reviews to maintain site quality and compliance.

## Team Members  
- Ullas Basavapatna Chandrashekar  
- Saptorshee Nag

## Project Goals  
- Develop an in-house solution that integrates product registration, bidding, and review functionalities.  
- Ensure real-time updates during bidding to enhance user engagement.  
- Provide an intuitive interface that caters to diverse user roles with appropriate permissions.  
- Implement administrative tools for monitoring and moderation to maintain auction integrity.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
